🌱 How to start this project
Do not clone or fork this repository, this is not a coding project.
Your teacher will open these slides and share the screen.
📝 Instructions
Wait for your mentor to open these slides.
Try completing the challenge with the whole class, have an open discussion and make suggestions.
Once the challenge is finished, split into groups; as many groups as possible, as long as there is one mentor in each group. For example: If there are 2 mentors in a class of 10 students, we will have 2 groups of 5 students each.
One student at a time will open their previous codes and start discussing them with their classmates.
The mentor will intervene as needed to ensure the group stays focused and on the right path.
